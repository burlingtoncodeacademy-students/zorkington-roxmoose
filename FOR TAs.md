Hi Bob & TAs!

Here's a little guide to help you follow along with my Zorkington project - the Pitkin Underland.

First, if you're interested, here's a playlist I made to inspire myself as I designed the world and to immerse myself as I worked on the code. It's pretty trippy / very Alice in Wonderland inspired, just like the Pitkin Underland.

Second, FYI: As far as I can tell, I completed all the stories, plus one Icebox challenge (the room location status).

Third, a lil USER GUIDE to make your life easier, if you'd like:
- User input can have as many words as you like, but the first word needs to be the action, and the last word needs to be the target.
- Allowed actions (assuming the action is allowed for the target): 
    - Take
    - Drop
    - Talk (to)
    - Sniff
    - Drink
    - Go (to)
    - Pull


***SPOILER ALERTS*** The rest of this might help you follow along & grade, but is full of ***SPOILER ALERTS*** so if you really want to play the game blind at first, don't read these till after.

A general MAP: 
The user starts out at the end of the real-life Pitkin Street, then is dropped down into the Pitkin Underland (which is based on real beings, places, and things on Pitkin Street). From there, the room order is:
Candlearium > Brickhouse Tavern > Pear Tree Root Cellar > Opossum Den > Bailey's Yard (locked!) > Strong Reservoir. 
From the Strong Reservoir, the user can either go down the river or the stream. Both end the game, in different ways.

Pointing out a few stories (if you think I missed any, please read this and check out the game again!)

The user won't be able to get to Bailey's yard without giving a pear (from the Root Cellar) to Dan the opossum (in the Opossum Den) via dropping the pear in the den. I think that counts for being *locked out* (from the yard). And it also involves adding something to the user's *inventory* (taking the pear) and *dropping* an item from the user's inventory and adding it to the *room inventory* (dropping the pear in the den). Once the player gets to Bailey's yard, they can go back to the yard from either the den or from the reservoir (*Keep it Open* story), as the pear has already been left in the opossum den. I think the rest of the stories are obvious.
